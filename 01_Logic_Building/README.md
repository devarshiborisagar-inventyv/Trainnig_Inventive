# Logic Building Using Flowcharts

## Overview
This repository focuses on strengthening **logic-building skills** by designing solutions using **flowcharts** before writing any code. The main idea is to visualize and validate the complete logic flow first, ensuring clarity and correctness.

## Why Flowcharts?
Flowcharts help to:
- Visualize problem logic step by step
- Break complex problems into smaller decisions
- Identify logical errors early
- Improve understanding before implementation
- Keep the solution language-independent

## Approach Followed
- Understand the problem statement clearly  
- Design the complete logic using flowcharts  
- Validate all decision paths, loops, and conditions  
- Ensure correctness before converting logic into code  

This follows a **logic-first, code-later** methodology.

## What This Repository Contains
- Problem-solving logic represented using flowcharts  
- Decision-making structures (if–else, loops, conditions)  
- Clear and readable logic diagrams for learning and revision  

## Benefits of This Method
- Strong problem-solving foundation  
- Easier debugging and reasoning  
- Better performance in interviews and exams  
- Reusable logic across different programming languages  

## Flowcharts (FigJam)
All flowcharts are created using **FigJam** for better visualization.
